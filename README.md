### About me and about the repositories
I have finished my PhD projects (conducted at the University of York, UK) in mathematical physics on algebraic field theory and causal sets. Most of my repositories here focus on causal set theory, a mathematical framework for research in quantum gravity and discrete models of spacetimes.

There are modules to create generic causal sets (locally finite, partially ordered sets) or generate them via a Poisson process (sprinkling). I started my first source code developments in [MATLAB](https://github.com/c-minz/MATLAB-causets), but moved to [Python](https://github.com/c-minz/Python-causets) (with mypy typing support) later on. [Some of the MATLAB source code](https://github.com/c-minz/diamondsprinkling) was used to generate the results published in [1]. 
This publication motivated me to write a [LaTeX-package "causets"](https://github.com/c-minz/LaTeX-causets) in order to create diagrams of causal sets, in particular for scientific/mathematical texts [2].

### Research interests and further source code developments
I conduct research on causal set theory and the algebraic formulation of quantum field theory (algebraic quantum field theory), as there are many open questions in these research fields. I see the connection between both areas with a great potential to study quantum field theory and quantum gravity.

As a side-project, I started to developed code for a reconstruction of a spacetime embedding of a generic causal set, which may also be used to draw a diagram (plot) for arbitrary finite causal sets. Some of the source code can already be found in [the Python-causets repository](https://github.com/c-minz/Python-causets).
