I am a researcher in theoretical and mathematical physics, working mostly on algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT, an algebraic approach to quantum field theory) and causal set theory (CST, a mathematical framework for research in quantum gravity and discrete models of spacetimes).
More information about me and my projects is on [my personal website](https://c-minz.github.io) hosted with GitHub Pages.

Most of my public repositories are code development for CST that started during my doctoral research at the University of York, UK. 
The [MATLAB repository](https://github.com/c-minz/MATLAB-causets) contains code to generate causal sets (locally finite, partially ordered sets) and to study causal sets with statistical methods, which was used to get the results published in [1]. 
To make numeric tools available without a MATLAB licence, I converted and remastered some of the code using [Python](https://github.com/c-minz/Python-causets) with mypy typing support. 
While the Python source code is not optimized for statistics of large data sets, it provides many functionality to visualise causal sets. 
My doctoral research motivated the creation of another tool for typesetting causal sets in mathematical expressions and scientific writing, the [LaTeX-package "causets"](https://github.com/c-minz/LaTeX-causets) available via CTAN [2], which is supported by the [online editor "PrOSET"](https://c-minz.github.io/assets/html/proset-editor.html) that helps to create diagram representations. 
More information on the tools for these diagrams are on the [project page "Hasse diagrams"](https://c-minz.github.io/projects/poset_diagrams).
